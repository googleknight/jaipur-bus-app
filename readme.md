Jaipur Bus Info

It is an android app that I have developed for my 3rd semester Java Project

The app is based upon the data of local low floor government buses that are running in Jaipur city. It helps user to get the information about all the stops that a particular bus goes. It helps user to find which bus he take to go from source to destination. The app easily finds out the direct route. It is also capable of finding alternate routes if no single direct bus is available.

It works on the preinstalled database management in android i.e., SQLite. The data of all the buses, bus stops are stored in 21 tables under a single database ‘businfo’ which is stored in assets of application, this file is copied to android`s data folder as the data is accessed.
